A game about strategy and placement!


Hello there! Welcome to this project called Epoc Bomb Game Thing(EBGT) A game about strategy and placement!
![Epoc Bomb Game Thing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/947a6c0d-1e4e-4546-8e1b-9c1884a65fc6)
## Overview
The goal of this game is to place blue squares called "bombs" in places that would be optimal that would hit the red squares called "targets". What hits the red squares you may ask? The orange squares called "shards" move out up, down, left, right, and diagonally in all directions with 8 coming out from each bomb where they have the ability to hit the targets.
In order to move on to the next round you must remove all the targets from the grid or you will reset back to the beginning of the level! as you pass through more round the more targets there are on the grid thus becoming harder to find out the exact location to hit all the targets so think strategically!
## Controls
There are basic movement controls to this game such as
- **W** (move forward)
- **A** (strafe left)
- **S** (move backwards)
- **D** (strafe right)

And other controls such as
- **Space** (place bomb)

There are also **development** keys in the game where later they would be removed
- **U** (tests shards)
- **K** (places 8 targets)
- **L** (removes all targets)
